description: Abstract - Computing and visualizing features in fluid flow often depends on the observer, or reference frame, relative to which the input velocity field is given. A desired property of feature detectors is that they are objective, which means that they are independent of the input reference frame. On the other hand, observer-relative visualizations highly depend on the chosen reference frame. By explicitly changing the observer we can arrive at drastically different visualizations. In this project we work on novel objective feature detection methods as well as observer-relative visualization methods. We explicitly model the reference frame and take all velocities as relative to one specific frame. By changing the reference frame, we visualize and detect features in the flow data in a physically plausible way.
