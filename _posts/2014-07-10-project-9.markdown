description: FedNL Making Newton-Type Methods Applicable to Federated Learning (arXiv:2106.02969, ICML 2021) bring a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) methods and is a significant step in making second-order methods applicable to Federated Learning(FL) and Distributed Optimization. This work is targeted to bring this algorithm close to practical application and makes a strong step toward practical applicability.
