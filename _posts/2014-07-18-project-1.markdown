description: 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) are cutting-edge deep learning technology that can generate 3D images and shapes from 2D images. They are particularly useful in creating 3D objects that are challenging or time-consuming to create using traditional methods. 3D GANs have applications in a wide range of fields, including computer graphics, video games, architecture, product design, and medical imaging. In this demo, we show the results of an efficiently trained 3D GAN with high-quality rendering and multi-view consistency. We then demonstrate applications of 3D GANs for creating and editing 3D avatars of a person to generate high-quality animations. We also show an extension of 3D GANs in video processing where we are able to change the attributes of a face in a video or render a video in novel views, for example, rendering a talking head in different poses.
