short-title: Diffractive lensless imaging
title: Diffractive lensless imaging with optimized Voronoi-Fresnel phase
project-date: January 2023
client: Qiang Fu <sup>1</sup>
category: <sup>1</sup>KAUST
description: Optical imaging devices suffer from long-standing problems of bulky volume and high cost. We demonstrate a diffractive lensless camera with spatially-coded Voronoi-Fresnel phase for high quality imaging applications. The resulting device offers miniaturized form factor, while preserving rich optical information for various portable configurations.
