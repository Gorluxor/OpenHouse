description: We address the problem of rendering a trained NeRF in real-time on resource-constrained devices. Our method achieves real-time performance by transforming a NeRF into a representation that trivially runs on standard graphics pipelines.  Specifically, our method distills the NeRF by extracting the learned density into a mesh, and the learned color information into a set of matrices that factorize the sceneâ€™s light field.
