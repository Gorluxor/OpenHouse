description: Dr. KID (Direct Remeshing for K-set Isometric Decomposition) is a puzzle-generation for a small set of nanostructures.  It decomposes the surface mesh into K set of identical segments (planar or curved polygons). A heuristic approach is adopted for creating identical female connectors and unique hinges for assembling and disassembling the puzzle segments. Dr. KID not only solves a geometric problem but also provides a real-world product for the scientific community.
