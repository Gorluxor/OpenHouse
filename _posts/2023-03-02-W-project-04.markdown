description: 'The proposed algorithms from the work of "FedNL: Making Newton-Type Methods Applicable to Federated Learning" (arXiv:2106.02969, ICML 2021) is a significant step in making second-order optimization methods applicable in Federated Learning and Distributed Optimization.  Our work closes the gap between presented theoretical algorithms and their practical implementation in modern hardware.'
