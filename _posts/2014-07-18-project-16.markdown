description: 'The rapidly growing size and complexity of 3D geological models has increased the need for level-of-detail techniques and compact encodings to facilitate interactive visualization and data analysis. In this collaboration with Saudi Aramco, we employ advanced techniques, such as level-of-detail and display-aware rendering, out-of-core data processing, and cutting-edge GPU technologies, to handle datasets with up to one trillion data points. Additionally, we present a probabilistic framework to decouple all dimensions of multivariate joint range queries to query any subset of attributes efficiently. Since our framework does not limit query accuracy to a fixed spatial subdivision, queries are jointly evaluated at the finest data granularity, even when a multi-resolution strategy is used for visualization.'
