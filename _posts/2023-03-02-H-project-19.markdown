description: Depth estimation is one of the most fundamental computer vision problems. While predicting depth from a single image is considered an ill-posed problem, there has been tremendous progress with learning-based methods in recent years. However, existing work either focuses on generalization performance disregarding metric scale, i.e. relative depth estimation or state-of-the-art results on specific datasets, i.e. metric depth estimation. In this work, we propose the first approach that combines both worlds, leading to a model with excellent generalization performance while maintaining metric scale. Our method improves the state of the art on the NYU Depth v2 indoor dataset by 18.9% in terms of relative absolute error (REL) and achieves unprecedented zero-shot generalization performance to four unseen indoor datasets with up to 48.2% mean relative improvement (mRI) across three metrics (delta, REL, RMSE). We can also train our model for both indoor and outdoor domains at the same time and generalize to eight unseen datasets from both domains while still outperforming the state-of-the-art on NYU Depth v2 by 16.8%.
