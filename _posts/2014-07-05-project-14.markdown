description: Abstract - Geometry is not only an important branch of mathematics, but it is also a source of beauty and plays a vital role in many applications. Geometry drives progress in industrial applications like computer-controlled milling, enables the cost-efficient realization of complex free-form architectural designs, and even allows for the creation of meta-materials with unique properties. We show how to use Kirigami to program curvature in flat sheets so they can snap into a predefined three-dimensional shape. Our approach even solves the more general problem of morphing any 3d surface to any other. Grid shells are one of the most efficient load-bearing structures. We demonstrate some of the fundamental geometric properties governing their shape and present the results of a student workshop held here at KAUST on the topic. We present a new method to generate CNC machining tool paths adapting to the curvature of the target surface to significantly improve the smoothness of the resulting surface and reduce the amount of post proÂ¬cessing needed to finish the surface.
The art of Origami, folding paper along straight lines, can be extended to curved folds. This enables the creation of intriguing designs and finds applications in design and fabrication. We present a method to approximate given surfaces by curved folded structures. Our latest work demonstrates the ability of deployable structures assembled from regular planar strips to form complex free-from surfaces.
